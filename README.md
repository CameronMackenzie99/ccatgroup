# CCAT Group

This site was made for an aviation consultancy who wanted a simple landing page and contact form for their business. It uses the [Astrowind](https://github.com/onwidget/astrowind) template, with SEO features built in. The Astro framework renders a fully static site, with the ability to "turn on" interactively in certain components using React, Svelte or other libraries to send a small amount of javascript to the client. I was going to use this for the contact form, but the form ended up not having complex requirements, so instead it is just a plain HTML form, connected to Netlify with a serverless function to submit the responses.

All content on the site is copyright CCAT group, but the template and layout is free to be modified and reused without acknowledgement as with the Astrowind template.
